# How to contribute

Meatshield aims to be a community project and we are happy to accept contributions
from anyone interested in helping. Here are some guidelines for helping out.

## Hierarchy of helping

There are different ways that you can help with the project, but some are more
helpful than others. The list below starts with the most helpful ways at the
top and moves down to the items which may not be helpful at all. Take a moment
to see how helpful you can be.

  * Working code with passing tests in a Pull Request. You the real MVP!
  * Working code with no tests or failing tests in a Pull Request
  * No code or broken code and a failing test in a Pull Request
  * Report an issue in GitHub and put some code in there
  * Report a well-worded issue in GitHub with no code.
  * Report a vaguely-worded issue in GitHub with no code or clues.
  * Bitch about something on Twitter
  * Bitch about something on Facebook

## Pull Requests

The easiest and best way to do this is to fork our repository and then send a
pull request. In your description, please be sure to note any related issues
(for example, if your PR fixes a previously-reported bug or implements an
existing enhancement request).

**Note**: This CONTRIBUTING.md was shamelessly ripped off of [yolothreats's](https://github.com/yolothreat) epic [UtilityBelt](https://github.com/yolothreat/utilitybelt) project.
